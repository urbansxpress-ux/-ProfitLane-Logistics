         Conestoga trailers (sometimes referred to as flatbed Conestoga trailers), combine the functionality of flatbeds with the protection of enclosed trailers — a perfect choice for freight that must remain dry, clean, and secure during transport. But booking the right Conestoga trailer loads can be tough due to their specific nature.
